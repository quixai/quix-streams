# Start with a minimal pipeline that you can customize to build and deploy your code.
# Add steps that build, run tests, deploy, and more:
# https://aka.ms/yaml

steps:
- script: |
    echo "Build dependencies"
    .ci\unix\build.cmd
  displayName: 'Build codebase'

- script: |
    echo "Running test"
    ./build/test/QuixStreaming_tst
