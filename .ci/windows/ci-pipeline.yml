# Starter pipeline
# Start with a minimal pipeline that you can customize to build and deploy your code.
# Add steps that build, run tests, deploy, and more:
# https://aka.ms/yaml

steps:
- script: |
    echo "Install dependencies"
    .ci\windows\install.cmd
  displayName: 'Install dependencies'

- script: |
    echo "Build dependencies"
    .ci\windows\build.cmd
  displayName: 'Build codebase'

- script: |
    echo "Running test"
    build\test\Release\QuixStreaming_tst.exe
  displayName: 'Run test'
